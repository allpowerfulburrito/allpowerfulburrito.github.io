			<h1>Making the Future Brighter</h1>
			<p>Alterra corp is dedicated to the advancement of humanity through exploration, technological advancement, and military expansion. We have funded and supplied the settlement of the borderworlds who then send us resources to keep pushing technology forward. We have also funded several expeditions in search of new habitable worlds for humanity. To maintain the integrity of the borderworlds we are also one of the largest military forces at humanity's disposal. Alterra Corp is both the shield and torch for humanity's future.</p>

			<h2>CF402-35 Incident</h2>
			<p><img src="newsphoto.jpg" class="bgpic"> Last week there was an unfortunate incident on colony CF402-35 that made headlines across the Federation. Sadly several radical groups within the colony believed that the colony would be better off as an independant planet. After trying to convince them to remain part of the Corp failed they resorted to violent and illegal means to remove our leadership from the planet. These actions required a swift and decisive intervention to protect Alterra Corp property. All rumors of abuses and excessive force are completely false.</p>
			
			<h3>Proposition HLX 6709-325</h3>
			<p>We are passing a proposition through the senate and council to lift regulations on colonies and expansion. This proposition will allow us to expand faster and farther because of the increased income from current colonies and less red tape around terraforming.</p>
			
			<h3><a href="" class="button">VOTE!</a></h3>
			<p>Please support our goal of expanding humanity's reach</p>
