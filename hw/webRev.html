		Please look at the code - is it clean and modern? Are they using HTML5 elements? Do they use tables? Does it validate?
		Does the layout make sense to you? How is it laid out - 1 col, 2 col, 3 col, etc? Is there a scrolling effect?
		Can you navigate around in it well - it is well done, just okay, or confusing?
		Colors - how many major colors does the site use? How do they use color effectively? Does it match their product or the audience?
		Little things - what little things does this site do that sets it apart? Examples might be curved corners, nice white space use, cool icons, nice text formatting, etc. Please look hard at the site to find these.

			<h1>2 Good Sites and 1 Bad</h1>

			<h2>Roberts Space Industries</h2>
				<p>This is probably one of the most visually pleasing websites I've come across. Everything is very professionally created and laid out. Everything the user can interact with has some sort of reaction to a hovering mouse. It has a very clean and easy interface and layout too. It is clear what every function does and how to navigate the website. The website also uses some pretty advanced design by implementing movable 3D models to represent assets in game. The code is html5, it is very cleanly written and well organised. In terms of layout the page has a header image, a navigation bar, and then a single central column where the news and updates are presented. The main color the sight uses is blue with occasional red and green. It really fits the futruistic astethic of the site. The whole decoration scheme is best described as futruistic/minimalistic.</p>

			<h2>Zillow</h2>
				<p>Zillow is an excellent example of a well designed website. I think it's actually won a few awards. The home screen is very simple. the color scheme is blue and white to create a simple professional look. The navigation menu is very simple with a search bar and four options for the user to choose from. The biggest part of this site is that it's so minialistic. It makes everything about navigating it so much easier. The code is html5 and like RSI it is very well organised, clean, and self adapting to screen size. When the user puts in a search the website thows up a map that depending on the location can be super cluttered, but on the side of the map zillow has simple images of houses with a link to their location on the map. As for the little things that Zillow does right, they excelled at making their site simple and easy to use. The search parameters are clearly shown and have simple names as well as the area that you are searching is clearly marked.</p>

			<h2>r/Ooer</h2>
				<p>This is one of those intentionally bad sites. It was made with the intention of being hard to look at and use. Code wise it is built off the reddit framework so the base code that lays out the website before the subreddit moderator can edit so it is very modern, clean, and organised. It is also in HTML5. Where the bad comes in is when the moderators start trying to break the reddit framework. The colors are bright and very offensive to the eyes. Many parts of the page are also flashing and moving constantly distracting the eye from finding a way to navigate the paage. It is almost impossible to read any of the text on the site because of the color pallette. Some parts of the design actually make the user physically uncomfortable.</p>
